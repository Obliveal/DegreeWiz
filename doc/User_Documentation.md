# User Documentation

After downloading the files and opening `index.html`, the DegreeWiz prototype should be open in a browser.

On the left side is the course search sidebar.\
On the right side is the plan view.

## Searching for Course
Use the search bar in the sidebar to look up OSU classes. Classes matching your search will populate the sidebar.

In each result, the course title and the course code is shown, followed by a description of the course and the number of credit hours.

## Adding Courses to the Plan
After searching for courses, drag and drop the course into the desired semester box shown in the plan view.

The semester box should populate with the course code of the dragged course. Additionally, the credit hours shown in the semester box should update automatically.

To remove a course, click the 'x' button to the right of the course.

## Course Tags
Course information is not fully implemented in this prototype, as it requires another external API or a large internal database of class tags. However, the base functionality is available. To view course tags, click on a course while it is in the plan view. A sentence displaying the course tags for that course should display under the plan view. Because this feature is not fully implemented, a placeholder tag is shown, except for the courses MATH 1151 and ENGR 1282.04H which have hardcoded tags for the sake of example.

## Checking Prerequisites and Saving Your Plan
These features are not implemented in this prototype, but the buttons for each are displayed for posterity.
